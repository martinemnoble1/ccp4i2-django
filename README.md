# ccp4x

## Development

Clone the project from GitHub,
install the dependencies, make an inital database migration
and start the Django development server for the REST API.
It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment.

```console
user:~$ git clone https://github.com/paulsbond/ccp4x
user:~$ cd ccp4x
user:~/ccp4x$ pip install --editable .
user:~/ccp4x$ python manage.py migrate
user:~/ccp4x$ python manage.py runserver
```

There should now be a browsable API with autogenerated forms
at http://localhost:8000.
For easy viewing of the REST API and Next.js logs separately,
start the Next.js development server in a new terminal.

```console
user:~/ccp4x$ cd next
user:~/ccp4x/next$ npm ci
user:~/ccp4x/next$ npm run dev
```

Open a browser at http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
The Django server and the Next.js server
will both automatically restart
when any changes are made to files.

If making any changes to the database models,
run the following commands to update the database
then restart the server:

```console
user:~/ccp4x$ python manage.py makemigrations
user:~/ccp4x$ python manage.py migrate
```
